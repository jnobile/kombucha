# Kombucha

## Here's a link to [photos of the process](https://photos.app.goo.gl/85OuAtGE50PIvdwS2) 

## Everything we learned is from:
* [Reddit Kombucha sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/)
* [Reddit Kombucha master recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/5b1ztm/reddit_master_kombucha_recipe/)
* Trial and error

## Our choices derive from our goals (your goals may be different):
* Taste good to everyone in the family
* Replace beer for health and financial reasons
* Replace kids' store-bought probiotic supplement
* Operate as close to zero-cost as possible
* Spend as little time as possible brewing tea and bottling fermented tea

## Tactics:
* Get a starter kit (a few cups of unflavored fermented tea and a pellicle) from a friend 
* Get free tea from people who have a closet full they've never used in years
* Use herbal tea (not a great food source for the fermenting process) and black tea in 50/50 split because people have *lots* of herbal tea they don't use
* Use repurposed GTS bottles from a friend who buys kombucha at the store. We manually removed the labels and wash them in the dishwasher after each use.
* Use one gallon pickle jars (free from local deli) for fermenting
* Brew sweet tea and then let it sit in a towel-covered pot for  24 hours before bottling. This let's it cool off to room temperature and and let's most of the city-water chlorine evaporate off (deadly to the active culture).
* Flavor the second fermentation with some combination of ginger root blended to paste, passion fruit concentrate, mint leaves, pureed fruit, rosemary, etc. These are things that taste good and we can get cheap or free. We strain the kombucha before drinking
* ALWAYS refrigerate the bottled kombucha before opening!! We usually leave bottled kombucha out on the counter at room temperature for at least a week before drinking in order to get really carbonated and infuse as much of the flavoring from ginger, etc as possible. As a result, they can be explosive if opened at room temperature but cooling them increases the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> the liquid can hold before saturating.
* We brew four gallons every 2/3 weeks

I'm always looking for ways to tweak the process to better align with our goals, so if you get going and find things that work well, do share!
